# README for Reinforcement Learning Folder

This folder contains code, resources, and notes related to the **Reinforcement Learning** course. Below is a detailed explanation of the contents:

1. **Paper-Presentation**: This course has a paper presentation every week, which is done by students, to allow us to catch up to recent advances. I presented the paper **`10_Heirarchial_RL.pdf`**, the slides for which are in file **`Recent Advances in Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL).pdf`**.

2. **`RL_Programming_Assignment_x.ipynb`**: Contains programming assignments for this course, these only contain the problem and not the solution and are just for reference, as they can change in the future.

## Interesting content

If you are intereseted in learning what are some active research areas in RL, I would suggest to go through [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmx4utxjUQD5yq6IKSEH4kp3_3xwPzlY7](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmx4utxjUQD5yq6IKSEH4kp3_3xwPzlY7).

And if you are interested in unserstanding linear algebra and proofs behind these algorithms, I will add my notes from IISc which go through these parts. They are a bit tough to follow, if you are interested then feel free to mail me.

## Usage Notes

All notes are present in **`Reinforcement-Learning.pdf`**, these are more than enough for quizzes, and programming assignments. However, it is possible that some new content is added to the course.
