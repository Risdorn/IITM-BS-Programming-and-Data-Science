# IITM-BS-PROGRAMMING-AND-DATA-SCIENCE

This repository contains the notes and code I have created for practice during my IITM BS in Programming and Data Science course.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

    .
    ├── Degree/
    |   ├── AI: SMPS/
    |       └── This course explores how intelligent agents solve problems. 
    |           It starts with blind search and moves on to heuristic search, 
    |           while also studying board games like Chess and Go, logical reasoning, 
    |           and approaches to domain-independent planning to achieve goals. 
    |           It concludes with constraint processing as an alternative to combining search and reasoning.
    |
    |   ├── Deep Learning/
    |       └── This course covers the basics of Neural Networks, including Convolutional Neural Networks 
    |           and Recurrent Neural Networks. It also teaches how these models can be applied to 
    |           solve problems in domains like Computer Vision, Speech, and NLP.
    |
    |   ├── Deep Learning Practice/
    |       └── This course covers the Practical aspect of Deep Learning. It teaches HuggingFace and Pytorch.
    |           I would highly recommend this course to everybody, after doing Deep Learning, this course in a
    |           way let's you appreciate the advances in the field of LLM, Speech, and Vision.
    |
    |   ├── Software Testing/
    |       └── This course focuses on the phases of testing based on project requirements. 
    |           It teaches how to formulate test requirements precisely, design and execute test cases, 
    |           and apply specialized test case design techniques for specific application domains.
    |
    |   ├── Software Engineering/
    |       └── This course teaches essential skills for becoming an effective software engineer, 
    |           covering fundamental concepts such as requirement gathering, software design, debugging, testing, 
    |           and deployment practices used in real-world development.
    |
    |   ├── Reinforcement Learning/
    |       └── This course teaches a bunch of algorithms essential to Reinforcement Learning. It allows you to
    |           almost catch up to the recent work being done in the field of RL. However, this course is very
    |           contetn heavy and might be too much if you are taking it with other heavy course. Regardless,
    |           I would suggest everyone to do this course, and if this course gets you interested in RL, I
    |           would suggest to go through the proofs and algebra behind these algorithms.
    |
    |   ├── static/                            # Contains images and other static resources used in the notes.
    |   ├── tex files for all notes            # LaTeX files for all notes prepared during the courses.
    ├── head.tex                               # Main LaTeX header file used across all notes.
    ├── python-cheatsheets.pdf                 # A handy reference for Python concepts.

Each course folder contains its respective notes, codes, and additional resources related to the topics covered.

## Future Notes Schedule

Upcoming notes will include the following topics:

- Large Language Models
- Deep Learning For Computer Vision

I will add the following notes, when I get time

- Natural Language Processing

Stay tuned for updates as I add notes for these subjects.
